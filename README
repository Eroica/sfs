# sfs â€” SimpleFileSystem

A Lua library for simple filesystem operations for when `luafilesystem` is too much. Aims at full POSIX and win32 compatibility.

The main difference is that when `mkpath` is called with nested folders, it will create all intermediate folders (similar to Window's implementation).

New methods will follow.
